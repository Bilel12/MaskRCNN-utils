Utilities for working with Mask R-CNN, a neural network for object instance segmentation.


Steps to train a model to segment vein instances using Mas R-CNN:
* Use [Labelbox](labelbox.io) to label rock veins on the image
* Export the Labelbox project as JSON.
* Generate single instance mask using the coordinates in the json. See MaskRCNN-utils/labelbox_parser notebook.
* Using the single instance masks together with their original image generated by labelbox_parser, apply augmentation to generate more samples. See MaskRCNN-utils/augmentor notebook
* Using the augmented dataset, run MaskRCNN-utils/Mask_RCNN/vein.sh to train the model
